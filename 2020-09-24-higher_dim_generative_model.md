* Spiked transport model
  * https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07513
  * just considering concepts and not the detailed proofs below, so it is sufficient to read up to the definition of spiked transport model (which is section 2 and 4).
* Introduction to Integral Probability Metrics (IPM)
  * https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.2698
* Barycenter of Wasserstein metric
  * To be implemented...
